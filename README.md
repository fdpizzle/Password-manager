# Password-manager
This is my password manager project

Current features:
Login (Although limited by not having SQL integration, so a specific username + password combination is used) 
How many characters the password can be (User input)
Generate password button (Click)
Copy to clipboard button (Click, works with Ctrl + V for pasting)


Upcoming features: 
SQLite integration to allow the user to sign-up and login with unique credentials
Website storage (Users will be able to store their websites, along with a username + password combination paired with the website) 
Website retrieval (Users will be able to search using a searchbar the name of the website, if present, username will be provided with a button to copy the password to clipboard (Will not display the password to enhance privacy) If not present then the user will be told that the website name isnt present in the database)
Password generation (Users will be able to generate a password for their website IN the website storage section (Uses will be given the option of inputting their own password or asking to generate a secure custom password) 
Some sort of encryption/hashing software (SHA-256)


Thank you !
